![Event](./img/event.png)

A hands-on workshop teaching network engineers how to leverage AI and LLMs for practical network automation, monitoring, and operations.

**Duration:** 5.5 hours | **Format:** Online, hands-on | **Date:** January 24, 2026

**Instructor:** William Collins

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand LLM fundamentals using network engineering concepts
- Use **Claude Code** to accelerate Ansible playbook development
- Build **MCP servers** that invoke Ansible playbooks via natural language
- Deploy AI-powered monitoring with Prometheus alerting tools
- Create agentic AI workflows for autonomous network operations

**Key Concept:** Each lab builds on the previous one:
1. Lab 1: Create Ansible playbooks with Claude Code
2. Lab 2: Add MCP tools that invoke those playbooks ("Add VLAN 15 to leaf2")
3. Lab 3: Extend MCP with Prometheus alerting tools
